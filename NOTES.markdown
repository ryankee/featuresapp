Approach
--------

The general approach is to focus on monitoring the health of the team rather than tracking the details of the projects.

Reports
-------

This app should be developed around the information people want to get from it.

*Programming/User Experience Design*

- What should I work on next?

*Project Management*

- What features are not done?
- What if anything is blocking the team?
